> _Convert [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) data into ROS [bag](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag) format_

## Migrated

This project is no longer maintained, it has been superseded by https://github.com/foxglove/nuscenes2mcap.

## Introduction

nuScenes is a large-scale dataset of autonomous driving in urban environments, provided free for non-commercial use. This project provides helper scripts to download the nuScenes dataset and convert scenes into ROS bag files for easy viewing in tools such as [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/).

## Usage

    # This builds the `nuscenes2bag` Docker image and downloads various nuScenes datasets into `data/`
    $ ./setup.sh

    # Start a Jupyter notebook server on port 8888
    $ ./start.sh

    # Look in the console for the auth token and open a browser to http://localhost:8888/?token=<token>
